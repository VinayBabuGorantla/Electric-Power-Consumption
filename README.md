# 🕒 Time Series Power Consumption Forecasting - Deep Learning MLOps Project

This is a complete **End-to-End MLOps Project** using **Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting** based on the **Household Electric Power Consumption** dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

Forecast the **Global Active Power** usage in the future based on historical data using LSTM/GRU models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📥 **Data ingestion** from raw `.txt` file (UCI repository)
- 🧼 **Preprocessing**: missing value handling, datetime parsing, resampling
- 🧠 **Deep learning model** (LSTM/GRU based)
- 📊 **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- 🗂 **DVC** for version control of data and models
- 🧪 **Modular codebase** with logging and exception handling
- 🌐 **Flask app** to input parameters and show future forecasts
